#Project Take Me To Church
Ride coordinators have a lot to think about:
* Am I aware of every person who wants a ride to church this week? 
* Did I coordinate details with drivers? 
* Did I forget anyone? (lol)  
* Do the drivers have the contact information and pickup information for all of their passengers?
* Who's leaving early? 
* Do I have enough drivers? Should I reach out to the church community to find more drivers to help? 
* How do I send a notification to everyone so they know if anything changes? 

This project aims to alleviate those problems and take care of the tedious work so that rides coordinators can focus on what they're good at: coordinating.
